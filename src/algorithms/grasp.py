def execute(inst: dict, config: dict, objective: int, iteration: int) -> Solution:
    '''The function executes a GRASP algorithm with a specified number of iterations and a given
    beta value, selecting the best solution found during the iterations.

    Args:
      inst (dict): a dictionary containing the instance data. The dictionary includes the number of
    nodes `n`, the number of nodes to be selected `p`, a distance matrix `d` representing the
    distances from each node to the rest of the nodes, a cost vector `a` with the costs of each
    node, and a capacity vector `a` with the capacities of each node.
      config (dict): contains the construction and local search strategies defined by the user in
    the config file.
      objective (int): ID of the objective considered for this iteration. {0: MaxSum, 1: MaxMin}.

    Returns:
        (Solution): the solution found.
