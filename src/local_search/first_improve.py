Auxiliar function to apply First Improve Local Search.
Objective functions selected and unselected elements are compared iteratively,
when the unselected element's result improves the selected one's, they are interchanged
in the solution.

    '''Attempts to improve a solution by selecting and interchanging a selected element (node)
    with an unselected element. The improvement is obtained if the new solution dominates the
    previous solution.

    Args:
      sol (Solution): contains the solution information.
      objective (int): ID of the objective considered for this iteration. {0: MaxSum, 1: MaxMin}.
      improvement_criteria (str): criteria used to consider that the new solution obtained with the
    exchange improves the previous one. It can be 'Dom', where the new solution must dominate the
    previous one to be better, or 'Alt', where if the new solution improves the last one in the
    objective function value in `objective`, an improvement will be assumed.
      switch (list): indicates the neighborhood being analized in the local search. The first
    element defines how many nodes will be removed from the solution and the second element
    determines the number of nodes that will be added to the solution. Defaults to [1, 1] for
    a standard 1-1 exchange.

    Returns:
      (bool): `True` if the improvement was successful (i.e., if the objective values are
    dominant and constraints are met with the interchange), and `False` otherwise.
