      config (dict): always contains a 'mo_approach_LS' key that indicates the strategy used in the
    Local Search phase to adapt the GRASP algorithm to the multi-objective problem. Additionally,
    it contains a 'strategy' key that indicates if a Variable Neighborhood Descent strategy will be
    used or a standar Local Search. If the 'strategy' is 'VND', it contains another 'neighborhoods'
    key with a dict value that contains the exchange list [n_nodes_out, n_nodes_in] for each
    explored neighborhood. Finally, the 'scheme' key indicated if a First, Best or Fast approach
    will be used to make the improvement.
